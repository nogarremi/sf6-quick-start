So you want to level up at Street Fighter but you don't quite want to do all the boring playing and training? 'Nough said.

Thanks for coming to Nogarremi's Never-ending Necessities For Getting Dubs (NNNFGD)

# 1. Learn basic combos with repeatable followups
Don't bother with learning Drive Rush conversions or anything of the sort. Start simple with a light (4f) starter combo, a medium (6-7f) starter combo, and a heavy(8-12f) starter combo. Focus on being able to pressure your opponent without spending any drive meter (for some characters this is impossible)

# 2. Watch your opponent and adapt
## 2a. Normals and Specials
You will get hit by your opponent. That's a given. What truly matters is what you do in response to that and if you can recognize the same scenario next time

If you use a move and it gets interrupted before it comes out, pay attention to the spacing you were at and what move your opponent used to catch it. The same thing if you get punish countered and vice versa, when you punish or interrupt your opponent, take note of the move your opponent did and your own. If you blocked and you tried a heavy punish and you didn't get a punish, try a medium punish so on and so forth for medium into a light

If you block and you try a light punish and you get counter hit, that means it's still your opponent's turn. You will have to remember to respect that move so that you don't get smoked.

## 2b. Throws
If you are blocking too much, your opponent will likely try to throw you. Throws aren't normally reactable (9f), so you have to react to the situations where your opponent tries to throw you instead. Sometimes you can check their walk forward but other times, you'll need to throw tech to escape the situation.

# 3. Nothingness is powerful
Be patient. Your opponents will start by throwing a lot at you but when you don't know anything gathering information is more important than enforcing your will by pushing more buttons

This isn't to say that you shouldn't push buttons and try to find your spots but you will find your opponents will be frustrated with your defense and expose themselves more

# 4. Jumping is a commitment
There is no air blocking in SF6. Once you leave the ground, you are exposed to your opponent. Some characters have air options that make trying to antiair riskier since they can shorten their jump arc or stay in the air longer. Make sure that you find options that make your opponent never want to leave the ground

# 5. Delay options in between your opponent's
This will be an option select that relies on the fact that while you are in blocking animation you won't get counter hit for inputting a move. This is most commonly used with throw or a 4f light move.

It requires a bit of practice being in blockstun or knocked down, but try to push your button a few frames (2-5f) after you think you will be blocking your opponent's move

This will give a good illusion of a layered defense but you should be very careful about using delay throw to tech (it's better to feel out situations that your opponent wants to throw in the first place, See #2) since your opponent could walk out of throw range and whiff punish your throw

# After you are comfortable with the above, review the below

# 6. Watch and learn from the pros
The pros aren't good to watch from the beginning because you won't understand everything they are doing. You need to establish a base level of understanding before tackling copying another.

Look up CPT tournament footage (from top 16s and above) to find people that play the same character and watch what they are doing. Pause frequently before the pro makes a decision, write down what you would do in that situation (block vs throw, the combo route, etc) and compare to what actually happens. Try to implement those changes into your gameplay one at a time

# 7. Learn more damaging combos
The more you play, the less you want to give your opponent additional chances to interact and survive. The more resources you spend, the more damage you'll do (typically) but ensure that you don't burn yourself out unless the combo will kill.

## 7a. Learn Drive Rush extensions
Take time to learn the common Drive Rush routes. Typically, you can do  DR Light > Medium and DR Medium > Heavy.

## 7b. Learn Super combos
Level 1 and Level 2 Supers don't cancel from regular specials so you will need to either link from a previous move or cancel from a normal

Level 3 Supers can be cancelled into from any special move but sometimes juggle restrictions will make some combos impossible
